Great passion and prior demonstrated ability to build things together in the founding team!  Good early results with customers, efficient presentation.  The noise level in the market is deafening right now, however, so you will need to spend more time around the question of differentiation from all the other social and influencer/content marketing solutions.  Given the supply/demand matching needs you will also need to spend more time explaining the influencer and advertiser outreach efforts: how do you manage quality on both sides, making the matching efficient at scale?  Also around business model: will you be able to support an influencer network with real $ or will this be so small for the influencers that you'll have issues scaling supply in the early days?

And once that happens, I can help you get sold through telcos.  Japanese and Korean telcos would love to offer your stuff to help sell more bandwidth.  China and Taiwan (our home markets) are possibilities as well.  Btw, your real competition that you would be taking down would be Skype.  I'd love to learn more.  I call my China RD team every day and Skype is a pain in the behind.  Giving you a 7 because I think you should broaden your scope and it's a dicey market.

Very interesting.  Great valute prop
Maybe discuss value prop more clearly - what is the initial hook to get people on.  What is the long term problem you are solving - increased daily productivity or exposing sales reps to more leads

Talk about focus verticals - how much tailoring needs to be done per vertical.  How hard it is it to get into new verticals.

- Think through how this works at scale, e.g. how do you create new SMB templates without much manual work on your end
- What additional value can you provide on top of the database? Can you provide something specific, e.g. historical data on sales performance, etc. with a more global comprehensive view of, e.g. dental offices. Would require some feedback loop to build this out.
- Where does this take you as a next step? Would think though the startup plan vs. the plan for permanence and can/how this starting point expands to something much more central to the salesperson.
